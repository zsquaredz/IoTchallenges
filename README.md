Motivation
  There’s no objective metric to measure driving behavior right now
  Example: 
    - Driving tests are executed in a subjective manner (instructors, examiners)
    - Insurance companies have trouble determining a new customer’s driving skills and thus their insurance fee quote
    
Data Collection & Analysis
 Micro Bit  
   - used as an accelerometer
   - Matplotlib to plot the real time acceleration change
   - Numpy to calculate standard deviation 
Vision
   - Camera and OpenCV
 Lego Car (developed previously)
    - a toy model simulating a real life scenario    
    - color sensor
Raspberry Pi – process data collected by Micro Bit. For this prototype, we are using a MacBook Pro due to computational requirements and connection problems

Future Application
  Auto-driving algorithms
  AI driving instructors
  Insurance quotes
